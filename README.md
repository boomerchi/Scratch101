# Summer Code Camp - Scratch 101

This is a 12-class syllabus aimed at children ages 7 to 11. The objective of this course is to provide an introduction to basic programming concepts, using Scratch as a foundational tool.

The focus will be on creating simple games, where each one either introduces new concepts while building on, and reinforcing the learnings from previous classes.

One very important tool that will be taught is the use of Flow Diagrams.  We don't want students jumping straight into solving the problems / creating the games. It's *essential* that we teach them to plan ahead.  All class projects should first be discussed at high level, to ensure understanding, imagine possible solutions and approaches. This discussion activity should be followed by creating a flow diagram for the agreed on solution (This will serve as a roadmap for the students to then implement their solution on Scratch). Only then should students move on to actually writing the program.

One of the beautiful things about Scratch, is that due to it's interface, a flow diagram will practically have a 1:1 mapping to the final program.

At the end of this course, students should be able to approach a new problem in a structured way, and apply engineering techniques for writing an algorithm / well structured program to solve it.  All students should feel comfortable moving up to a whiteboard and explaining their thought process.

## Class 1
Introduction to computers / programming

### Objectives:
* Welcome students. Level set about expectations for code camp
* Talk about basic computer concepts (CPU, Memory, Networking)
* Very brief history of computers, showing images from early computers	(ENIAC, Disc Storage Devices, etc), compare against modern equivalents
* Explain that computers are extremely dumb, and they will do exactly what you tell them to. Run a practice excercise where kids give you instructions and you follow them *literally* (eg: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDA3_5982h8 )
* Intro to Scratch (Ensure students all have accounts so they can save their projects)
* Dance Animation mini project: http://scratch.mit.edu/dance/ 


## Class 2
Number Guessing Game

Special note: Class 2 should begin with and explanation of Flow Diagrams. 

### Objectives Part 1 - You guess the computer's number
* Input / Output
* Variables
* Random Number generation
* If - else statements.


Class #3
Number Guessing Game - The computer guesses your number


Class #4
Hangman


Class #5
Interaction with camera


Class #6
Pong  

Special Note: Talk about the history of video games, but do it backwards. Start with todays modern games, and work your way down to Atari / Pong.  Use plenty of visual examples.	

### Objectives
* Variables for keeping score
* Keyboard control for games
(Fun activity: Pong Tournament with the best project in the class)


Class #7
Cat & Mouse Game (Artificial Intelligence)


Class #8
Flappy Bat


Class #9


Class #10
Angry Birds


Class #11
Angry Birds (Cont.)

Class #12
Presentations
